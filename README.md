# Machine Learning Project with PyTorch

## Introduction

Welcome to my machine learning project! This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a neural network using PyTorch. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build and deploy a simple neural network model for a binary classification task.

## Features

- Implementation of a neural network using PyTorch.
- Training on a custom dataset.
- Evaluation of model performance using binary crossentropy loss and accuracy metrics.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the neural network model, use the following commands:

1. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset path_to_dataset --epochs 100
   ```

2. Evaluate the trained model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path saved_model.pth --test_data path_to_test_dataset
   ```

## Training

During training, the model architecture includes a simple fully connected neural network with ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid activation for the output layer. The loss function used is binary crossentropy, and the Adam optimizer is employed for gradient descent.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure accuracy and loss. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 90% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in the binary classification task.
